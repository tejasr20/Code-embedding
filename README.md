# Code-embedding
Creating scalable vector embeddings of code that is usable in finding analogy, finding similarity, categorization and finding outliers.
Please download the py150 dataset and place in the main folder to run the code.
The file code2vec.ipynb contains methods for converting python source code to embeddings, largely based on AST.
